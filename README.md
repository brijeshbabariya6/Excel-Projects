# Data Analysis Project: Uber Rides Analysis in Excel

## Project Overview

- The objective of this data analysis project is to explore and derive meaningful insights from the Uber rides dataset. 
- The dataset contains information about the start and end times, locations, distances, and purposes of Uber rides.

## Dataset Description

### Columns:
1. **START_DATE\***: Date when the ride started.
2. **Start Time**: Time when the ride started.
3. **END_DATE\***: Date when the ride ended.
4. **End Time**: Time when the ride ended.
5. **CATEGORY\***: Category of the Uber ride.
6. **Time Diff.**: Time difference between start and end.
7. **Hours Diff.**: Hours difference between start and end.
8. **START\***: Starting location.
9. **STOP\***: Ending location.
10. **MILES\***: Distance covered in the ride.
11. **Speed**: Speed during the ride.
12. **PURPOSE\***: Purpose of the ride.
13. **PURPOSE**: Additional information about the purpose.

### Data Analysis Goals:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understand the distribution of rides over time.
   - Analyze the distribution of ride distances.
   - Explore the most common start and stop locations.

2. **Time Analysis:**
   - Identify peak hours and days for Uber rides.
   - Analyze average duration and distance for different times of the day.

3. **Location Analysis:**
   - Identify popular start and stop locations.
   - Analyze the relationship between distance and ride category.

4. **Purpose Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of ride purposes.
   - Analyze the average distance and duration for different ride purposes.

5. **Speed Analysis:**
   - Investigate the distribution of speeds during rides.
   - Identify any patterns or outliers in speed data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Check and correct data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
   - Calculate summary statistics for relevant columns.

3. **Time Analysis:**
   - Create time-based visualizations (line plots, bar charts).
   - Calculate average duration and distance for different time periods.

4. **Location Analysis:**
   - Use geospatial visualizations to identify popular locations.
   - Compare distances for different start and stop locations.

5. **Purpose Analysis:**
   - Create pie charts and bar charts to visualize the distribution of ride purposes.
   - Analyze average distance and duration for each purpose.

6. **Speed Analysis:**
   - Identify and investigate outliers in speed data.
   - Visualize speed distribution.

## Results and Conclusion

Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis. Highlight any trends, patterns, or interesting observations. Discuss how these insights can be valuable for Uber or for users in optimizing their ride experiences.

## Recommendations

Provide recommendations based on the analysis for improving the Uber experience, optimizing routes, or enhancing service in specific locations or during certain times.
